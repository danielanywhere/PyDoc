# PyDoc
An automated language documentation generator for the Python language, written in C#.<br />
<sup>Version 1.0. Published 20180412.1200</sup>

This is a .NET console application that creates a deep-linking encyclopedic documentation reference from any Python project.
The test project is the complete Python source of the **doit** GitHub project, which currently expands to 6,678 separate
hyperlinked object documentation files.

You can review the documentation output of the **doit** project [here](http://www.localmarketproductions.com/PyDocSamples/). The Index.html file lists all source files found.

Final documentation results depend somewhat on how well you comment your source files, and how descriptively you name all of the functional elements.
