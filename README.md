# PyDoc
An automated language documentation generator for the Python language, written in C#.<br />
<sup>Version 1.0. Published 20180412.1200</sup>

This is a .NET console application that creates a deep-linking encyclopedic documentation reference from any Python project.
The test project is the complete Python source of the **doit** GitHub project, which currently expands to 6,678 separate
hyperlinked object documentation files.

You can review the current test output [here](https://github.com/danielanywhere/PyDoc/Samples/Index.html),
or by clicking on the **Samples** folder of this project, then opening any file in that folder.

The Index.html file lists all source files found.
