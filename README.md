# PyDoc
An automated language documentation generator for the Python language, written in C#.<br />
<sup>Version 1.0. Published 20180412.1200</sup>

This is a .NET console application that creates a deep-linking encyclopedic documentation reference from any Python project.

The test bed for this project is the complete Python source of the [**pydoit / doit**](https://github.com/pydoit/doit) GitHub project. The Python source consists of roughly 129 files, and the output currently expands to 6,678 separate hyperlinked object documentation files.

You can review the documentation output of the **doit** project [here](http://www.localmarketproductions.com/PyDocSamples/). The Index.html file lists all source files found.

Final documentation results depend somewhat on how well you comment your original Python source files, and how descriptively you name all of the functional elements.
